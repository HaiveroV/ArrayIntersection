# ArrayIntersection

Showing a way to intersect 2 arrays

* First I declare two arrays of type int, which can take numbers from console
as user input.

* Second I need to parse the string into an integer for the name of the variable
which holds the size of the array that the user declares.

* Third I use for loop to input the desired numbers in the array.

* Fourth I use the Intersect extension method to find the common numbers
between the two arrays.

* Fifth I use foreach loop to print the intersection of the two arrays.
